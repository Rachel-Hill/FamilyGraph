# FamilyGraph
Web site of family tree data stored and displayed in a graph 

I'm new to web development and Neo4j but I have extensive relational database experience.  I'm using this project to learn. I have a GEDCOM file from FamilyTreeMaker to be parsed and imported into Neo4j. Existing web sites and desktop software present family data in a boring, limited way. I believe that graph technology is perfect for geneology data.
